# Transformers-for-Computer-Vision
https://huggingface.co/spaces/onlyumangsri/flowers

I leveraged pre-trained transformer models to boost the performance of our computer vision tasks. The steps include:
- Importing pre-trained models from TensorFlow and Hugging Face libraries.
- Fine-tuning the models on our specific datasets.
- Evaluating the models' performance and comparing it with baseline models.

To make our project more accessible and user-friendly, I implemented an interactive interface using Gradio. This allows users to:
- Upload images and get predictions from the model in real-time.
- Visualize the results and understand the model's performance interactively.
